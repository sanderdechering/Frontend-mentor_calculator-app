### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### What I learned

The calculator is one that I developed for the first time with Javascript. My first iteration was one that I came up by myself, one that I have not included here, but after struggling I looked up how people usually build these thing. The eval() function was one
that I have never heard of, so using this function here made the calculator app a lot easier to build. Also, adding a toggle button that doesn't toggle between true or false, but between 1,2,3 was something new.
